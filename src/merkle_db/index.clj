  "The data tree in a table is a B+ tree which orders the partitions into a

  The branching factor determines the maximum number of children an index node
  in the data tree can have. Internal (non-root) index nodes with branching
  factor `b` will have between `ceiling(b/2)` and `b` children.

  An empty data tree is represented by a nil link from the table root. A data
  tree with fewer records than the partition limit is represented directly by a
