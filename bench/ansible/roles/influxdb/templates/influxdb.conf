### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified.  The commented out lines are the the configuration
# field and the default value used.  Uncommentting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to enable reporting.
reporting-enabled = false

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"


###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "{{ influxdb_data_dir }}/meta"

  # Automatically create a default retention policy when creating a database.
  retention-autocreate = false

  # If log messages are printed for the meta service

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores TSM files.
  dir = "{{ influxdb_data_dir }}/data"

  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.
  wal-dir = "{{ influxdb_data_dir }}/wal"

  # Trace logging provides more verbose output around the tsm engine. Turning
  # this on can provide more useful output for debugging tsm engine issues.
  # trace-logging-enabled = false

  # Whether queries should be logged before execution. Very useful for troubleshooting, but will
  # log any sensitive data contained within a query.
  # query-log-enabled = true

  # Settings for the TSM engine

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.
  # cache-max-memory-size = 1048576000

  # CacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will
  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = 26214400

  # CacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration is the length of time at
  # which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to
  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes
  # cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "10m"

  # CompactFullWriteColdDuration is the duration at which the engine
  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "4h"

  # The maximum series allowed per database before writes are dropped.  This limit can prevent
  # high cardinality issues at the database level.  This limit can be disabled by setting it to
  # 0.
  # max-series-per-database = 1000000

  # The maximum number of tag values per tag that are allowed before writes are dropped.  This limit
  # can prevent high cardinality tag values from being written to a measurement.  This limit can be
  # disabled by setting it to 0.

### [coordinator]
###
### Controls the clustering service configuration.
###

[coordinator]
  # The default time a write request will wait until a "timeout" error is returned to the caller.
  # write-timeout = "10s"

  # The maximum number of concurrent queries allowed to be executing at one time.  If a query is
  # executed and exceeds this limit, an error is returned to the caller.  This limit can be disabled
  # by setting it to 0.
  # max-concurrent-queries = 0

  # The maximum time a query will is allowed to execute before being killed by the system.  This limit
  # can help prevent run away queries.  Setting the value to 0 disables the limit.
  # query-timeout = "0s"

  # The the time threshold when a query will be logged as a slow query.  This limit can be set to help
  # discover slow or resource intensive queries.  Setting the value to 0 disables the slow query logging.
  # log-queries-after = "0s"

  # The maximum number of points a SELECT can process.  A value of 0 will make the maximum
  # point count unlimited.
  # max-select-point = 0

  # The maximum number of series a SELECT can run.  A value of 0 will make the maximum series
  # count unlimited.

  # The maximum number of series a SELECT can run. A value of zero will make the maximum series
  # count unlimited.
  # max-select-series = 0

  # The maxium number of group by time bucket a SELECt can create.  A value of zero will max the maximum
  # number of buckets unlimited.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  # Determines whether retention policy enforcment enabled.
  enabled = true

  # The interval of time when retention policy enforcement checks run.
  check-interval = "10m"


###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

[shard-precreation]
  # Determines whether shard pre-creation service is enabled.
  enabled = true

  # The interval of time when the check to pre-create new shards runs.
  # check-interval = "10m"

  # The default period ahead of the endtime of a shard group that its successor
  # group is created.
  # advance-period = "30m"


###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]
  # Whether to record statistics internally.
  store-enabled = true

  # The destination database for recorded statistics
  store-database = "_internal"

  # The interval at which to record statistics
  store-interval = "10s"


###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  bind-address = "127.0.0.1:{{ influxdb_api_port }}"

  # troubleshooting and monitoring.

  # The JWT auth shared secret to validate requests using JSON web tokens.
  # shared-sercret = ""

  # The default chunk size for result sets that should be chunked.
  # max-row-limit = 10000

  # The maximum number of HTTP connections that may be open at once.  New connections that
  # would exceed this limit are dropped.  Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.
  # max-connection-limit = 0

  # Enable http service over unix domain socket
  # unix-socket-enabled = false

  # The path of the unix domain socket.
  # bind-socket = "/var/run/influxdb.sock"


###

  # interval for how often continuous queries will be checked if they need to run
  # run-interval = "1s"
