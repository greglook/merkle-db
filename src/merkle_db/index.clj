;; ## Update Functions

;; Insertion
;;
;; Perform a search to determine what bucket the new record should go into.
;;
;;     If the bucket is not full (at most b âˆ’ 1 {\displaystyle b-1} b-1 entries after the insertion), add the record.
;;     Otherwise, split the bucket.
;;         Allocate new leaf and move half the bucket's elements to the new bucket.
;;         Insert the new leaf's smallest key and address into the parent.
;;         If the parent is full, split it too.
;;             Add the middle key to the parent node.
;;         Repeat until a parent is found that need not split.
;;     If the root splits, create a new root which has one key and two pointers. (That is, the value that gets pushed to the new root gets removed from the original node)
;;
;; B-trees grow at the root and not at the leaves.[1]


;; Deletion
;;
;;     Start at root, find leaf L where entry belongs.
;;     Remove the entry.
;;         If L is at least half-full, done!
;;         If L has fewer entries than it should,
;;             If sibling (adjacent node with same parent as L) is more than half-full, re-distribute, borrowing an entry from it.
;;             Otherwise, sibling is exactly half-full, so we can merge L and sibling.
;;     If merge occurred, must delete entry (pointing to L or sibling) from parent of L.
;;     Merge could propagate to root, decreasing height.
